What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Running git init under a directory creates a new hidden folder titled ".git". This allows git bash to work properly under the directory. Without initalization, the git commands
like log, checkout and diff will not work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the temporary intermediate step of creating a commit from the working directory to the git repository. It has no real value without potential files to be
considered added to the next commit.
