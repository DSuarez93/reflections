mkdir: make a new directory
rmdir: remove directory
wget <http://>: retrieve file from website
touch <file>: creates a file, updates time modified if existing
echo "text" > <destination>: inputs text into a file
	-e : interprets code in quotes outside literal text
	\n : new line
cat <target>: prints file to terminal
cp <target> <destination>: makes 1:1 copy of file to new place
scp <target> <remote destination>: securely copies files, even to a remove location
tree: draws files, directories and children
sort <target>: sorts files alphabetically
uniq <target>: only displays unique contents in each line of file

	-i: ignore case
