The Arch Linux partition will be created from a CD-ROM containing the burned image of the .iso.

Before any work needs to be done with Arch Linux, it needs to have working wirless internet access and a properly functioning boot menu. Everything else can be edited later.

As discovered previously, the wi-fi card for the Inspiron 1525 may be outdated, so it needs to be extracted and compiled from an outside source.

List the details here once complete.

Use the following to identify the missing firmware for the wi-fi card:
dmesg | grep firmware
lspci -k
http://linuxwireless.sipsolutions.net/en/users/Drivers/b43

Obtain an extraction tool and the driver bundle, and extract them to /lib/firmware. Upon initial installation, pacstrap base, then reboot. Inside the root, pacman base-devel, then proceed with making the fwcutter. Activate netctl-auto and wpa_supplicant in the meantime.


wget http://bues.ch/b43/fwcutter/b43-fwcutter-018.tar.bz2 http://bues.ch/b43/fwcutter/b43-fwcutter-018.tar.bz2.asc
gpg --verify b43-fwcutter-018.tar.bz2.asc
* If failed, use the key given on the website:
tar xjf b43/fwcutter/b43-fwcutter-018.tar.bz2
cd b43-fwcutter-018
make
sudo make install

Change directory to the firmware, download the driver and use the fwcutter tool.
wget http://www.lwfinger.com/b43-firmware/broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2
tar xjf broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2
sudo b43-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware broadcom-wl-5.100.138/linux/wl_apsta.o

The wireless driver has been successfully installed, and it activates on startup, listening to netctl-auto and attempting to connect to active profiles. Use wifi-menu for any new connections.

Windows Boot:

Attemped a new entry for Linux into the Windows Boot Loader was created using bcdedit:
65af86ec-4939-11e5-825c-0023ae0e6c66

Ended up installing GREP. Turning on laptop boots GREP:
/dev/sda1 is Windows 10 boot to root partition found on /dev/sda2
/dev/sda5 is the 2.4G swap space for Linux
/dev/sda6 is Arch Linux

New questions:
Bluetooth?
