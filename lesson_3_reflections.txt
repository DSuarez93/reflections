When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Two reasons I would consider using a remote repository rather than local work would be collaborative work and local memory.
Remote repositories on Github allow anyone I want to simply clone the repository and edit alongside me, and they also use
memory space to archive the history of projects which may not be needed locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually creates a rhythm or pattern of consistent work and keeps the user aware of the status update of the code. Relying on automatic pull requires Git to always
be aware of the status, even when you are not, and it holds Git responsible if it cannot update due to a connection problem or repository conflict. After all, all push and pull
commands are timestamped, so it records when the user, not Github, makes updates or commits to the project. In addition, some features to be implemented do not require the latest
update but rather a stable version from some point, and manually pulling changes assures that only that version, nothing more, is brought in locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to make clones on Github of repositories of other users, useful for copying projects without changing or modifying existing ones. Clones take repositories from
either Github or local machines and make a dublicate on the local machine. Branches change the path of commits and modifications within one repository.
