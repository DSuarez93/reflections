When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Two reasons I would consider using a remote repository rather than local work would be collaborative work and local memory.
Remote repositories on Github allow anyone I want to simply clone the repository and edit alongside me, and they also use
memory space to archive the history of projects which may not be needed locally.
